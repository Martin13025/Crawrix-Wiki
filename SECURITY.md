## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not report it publicly via GitHub issues**.

Instead, report it confidentially by emailing:

We aim to respond within **3â€“5 business days**. After confirming the issue, weâ€™ll work on a fix and notify you of progress. In some cases, we may coordinate a responsible public disclosure with credit to the reporter.

Thank you for helping make Crawrix safer for everyone!
