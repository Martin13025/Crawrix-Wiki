# Changelog 🚀

## 🪐GRAND UPDATE v3.0.0 – Changes Overview

### Removed
- Aggressive mode from both frontend and backend.
- OpenLibrary API (no longer used for link fetching).
- Any UI components related to aggressive mode (e.g., `AggressiveModeToggle` in React).
- Yahoo search included only as a basic fallback; aggressive combined queries were removed.

### Added
- Integration with **Qwant API** (free search engine) for keyword-specific searches.
- Integration with **Hacker News API** to fetch relevant posts.
- Integration with **StackExchange API** to search questions and answers exactly matching keywords.
- **DuckDuckGo, Bing, Wikipedia, Reddit** remain as search sources.
- Frontend automatically sends keywords and language to backend without any aggressive mode parameters.
- Exact keyword search for all APIs where possible to improve relevance.

## 🌀 GRAND UPDATE v2.0.0 – Changes Overview

## 🔍 What’s Changed?

### Security Improvements:

* **Implemented URL safety validation**:

  * Blocked private IP ranges (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x`).
  * Blocked localhost addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`).
  * Blocked reserved, loopback, and multicast IPs.
  * Allowed only `http` and `https` URL schemes.

* **Added Input Validation**:

  * `keywords` must be a list.
  * Limited to **10 keywords per request**.
  * Each keyword must be a **string** and **no longer than 50 characters**.

* **Added Error Handling**:

  * All HTTP requests are wrapped with `try-except` to catch connection and parsing issues.
  * Prevented unexpected crashes if DuckDuckGo or Yahoo changes their page structure.

* **Added Request Rate Limiting**:

  * **Global** limit: **10 requests per minute**.
  * **/parse endpoint**: **5 requests per minute**.

### Technical Stack Used:

| Feature         | Library               | Purpose                               |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| SSRF Protection | `ipaddress`, `urllib` | Block unsafe network targets          |
| Rate Limiting   | `Flask-Limiter 3.12`  | Prevent DoS / abuse attacks           |
| HTML Parsing    | `BeautifulSoup`       | Safe scraping of search results       |
| HTTP Requests   | `requests`            | External requests with error handling |
| CORS Handling   | `flask_cors`          | Control allowed client origins        |

## 🧪 Testing

* Verified SSRF protection with safe and unsafe URLs (e.g., private IPs, localhost).
* Simulated search engine structure changes to ensure graceful failure.
* Tested rate limiting behavior by sending rapid requests.
* Validated keyword input constraints and error messages.

## 💬 Additional Notes

Reviewers should focus on:

* URL safety logic correctness.
* Rate limiting thresholds.
* Keyword validation constraints.
* Error message consistency for client-side handling.
